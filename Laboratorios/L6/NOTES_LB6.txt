NOTE ADC RESULT MUST BE CONSULTED VIA INTERRUPT, BUSY WAIT STOPS PIC18 FROM RUNNING ANY OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES WE HAVE IN THE MCU CURRENTLY:

The PIC18 has a 10-bit A/D Successive Approximations converter.

- The number of analog inputs varies among different PIC18 devices.
- The A/D converter has the following registers: 

   •A/D Result High Register (ADRESH) 
   •A/D Result Low Register (ADRESL) 
   •A/D Control Register 0 (ADCON0) (source selection) 
   •A/D Control Register 1 (ADCON1) (reference selection) 
   •A/D Control Register 2 (ADCON2) (timing selections)

- The contents of these registers vary with the PIC18 members.
- Other parameters must be considered: ANSELX (pin configurations), ADIF, ADIE, ADIP (for AD interrupt).
